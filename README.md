# IPPs-critical-point
Code to compute the critical point of Inverse Patchy Particles.

The folder IPPcode contains the C code that performs the numerical simulation of the model. The code is an adaptation of the code made available [here](https://github.com/lorenzo-rovigatti/PatchyParticles).

The fundamental file of this repository is the notebook IPPs_critical_point.ipynb. The notebook is (supposed to be) self-explanatory and easy to use. The folder pylibs contains functions used in the notebook.
